# Rebase Summary

- The `texas-holdem-rebased` branch was created after rebasing the feature work onto `main` (commit `af39a88`).
- All application files introduced by the Texas Hold'em overhaul remain intact on top of the refreshed history.
- Use this branch for further development or to open a pull request targeting `main`.
